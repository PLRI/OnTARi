# OnTARi
A multitude of factors may influence treatment adherence of patients with chronic diseases in rehabilitation. The effects of such factors always depend on the individual patient and are therefore rarely evidenced.

OnTARi “Ontology for factors influencing therapy adherence to rehabilitation” is a generic reference model representing potential adherence and motivation factors and their interrelations in rehabilitation of patients with chronic diseases.
In terms of information retrieval, OnTARi can serve as a basis for implementation and adaptation of conventional rehabilitative measures, taking into account (patient-specific) adherence factors. OnTARi also enables the development of medical assistance systems to increase motivation and adherence in rehabilitation processes.

OnTARi includes 281 classes implemented in ontology web language, ten object properties, 22 data properties, 1440 logical axioms, 244 individuals, and 1023 annotations.
